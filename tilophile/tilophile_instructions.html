<p> The main unit cell for a particular tiling type is in the middle and has large triangles at the vertices.
Click the mouse on a line segment between these triangles to add a new point.
Hold the mouse down and drag and the line seqments will deform to follow it.
Also, another vertex will automatically be created and will track your movements based on the symmetry type of the tiling.
For tilings with "Opposite" symmetry you will see it created on the segment directly opposte.  For "Rotational" symmetry,
you will see it created on an adjacent segment. </p>

<p> Choose the symmetry/tiling type using the drop down called "Tile Type" towards the top.
Choosing a new tile type will refresh the web page so make sure to save your previous work using the "Save File" option. </p>

<h3><mark> Saving and Loading Local Files </mark></h3>
<b>Save File</b> - Saves your work. But will save just the vertex model. <br>
<b>Restart File</b> - Restart your work using a file you saved (usually goes to Downloads directory). <br>
<b>Image File</b> - Load any jpg or png file and use it as texture to fill your tilings. <br>

<b>Right click anywhere in Tiling Area</b> - To save what you have done on the screen as an image.

<h3><mark> Controls </mark></h3>
<b> Keyboard z </b>  -  zoom in <br>
<b> Keyboard x </b>  -  zoom out <br>
<b> Cursor Up/Down </b> - increase/decrease value of parameters by small amounts <br>
<b> Mouse Wheel </b> - also increases/decreases values of parameters by small amounts <br>
<b> Mouse Click </b> - if your click is near enough to a line segment that belongs to the main unit cell you will add 2 new Vertices <br>
<b> Mouse Drag </b> - if you drag a point you just added, the adjacent segments and the "opposite" ones will deform to track the mouse

<h3><mark> Parameters and Options </mark></h3>
In the section towards the bottom left one can click on the button to the left of the parameter in order to set that parameter
as the one that changes when one scrolls the mouse wheel or hits Cursor Up/Down. Many of these parameters change the fill and colors
of the tilings in real time. <br><br>
Click in the Text Box to type in a number directly <br>
Also when hovering over the Text Box you will see an Up/Down arrow. Click here to increase/decrease by 1.
